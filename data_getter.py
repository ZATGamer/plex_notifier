# This will be the script that gets the data from Plex and added it to it's local DB for use in other bits of code.

# We will call the Plex API and get the recently added items.

# We will parse the XML to something more useful

# We will connect to the DB

# For each item from the Plex Recently Added API we will look to see if it exits in the DB
    #If does not exist added it to the DB
    #Else do nothing
